# Verbal syntax in 1-2 Kings

This project focuses on verbal syntax, currently limited to yiqtol (i.e., imperfect) and imperative forms. 

Relevant verb forms are identified based on the BHSA data set and then tagged with further information. The goal is to analyze the syntax of yiqtol verbs as it expresses aspect and modality. I focus initially on deontic modality.

All relevant data are stored in `data.json`. Other `.json` files may be ignored as they are temporary or redundant. The data are still stored in a somewhat inconvenient format (a simple dictionary), so please consult the notebooks for details if you are interested.

Moreover, please note that the tags/categories used are preliminary. Some tags were only used in early passes of manual tagging and later superseded. Again, consult the notebooks for details. I have also not had the time to double-check everything. 

If you only care about (preliminary) results, notebooks named `analysis...ipynb` are a place to start. Do let me know if you have any suggestions.
